###micheal's magic corner of shitty ideas
- pure element bullshit
- mixing of elements, but still cast pure
- enchanted into weapons, etc.
- specific roles (shield, attack, etc.)
- uses an item to facilitate magic use
- item = spell
- spells made from other things, put into items
- summons
- situational / conditional
- combinational
- experimental (might go with conditional, situational, mixing of elements)
- from things
- witchcraft potion nature bullshit
- nature stuff
- souls
- blood
- based off of some obscure heirarchy system of elements and conversions
- glyphs

- screw it, how about steam-work, get sum industry up in this bitch
  - http://www.zachtronics.com/the-bureau-of-steam-engineering/
- or soviet electrical engineering http://www.zachtronics.com/kohctpyktop-engineer-of-the-people/
- magic should be quite obscure and hard to get.
  - players / characters should be grateful for magic
  - should be hard to get
  - should have SOME SERIOUS SKILL RUST, BRUH
- affinity system
- alchemy
- PLAYERS SHOULD FEEL EFFECT OF MAGIC
  - SIMPLY DOING MORE DAMAGE OR APPLYING AN EFFECT EACH TURN != GOOD MAGIC
